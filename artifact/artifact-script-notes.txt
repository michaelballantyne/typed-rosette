# notes for popl2018
- using Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus) resulted in "SSH timeout err"
  - reverting to Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (Trusty Tahr) gets past the err

- Welcome to the first start of the panel:
  - Choose below which setup you want for the first startup:
    - "Use default config"
    - Other option is "One empty panel"

- to create .ova file, choose "export appliance" in virtualbox
  - used default args (eg, ovf 1.0)
